## Local News:
-   Governor Cuomo gave a[  speech](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-unveils-agenda-first-100-days-2019-justice-agenda) outlining his plans for the 2019 legislative session. The media focused on his call to legalize recreational[  marijuana](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/17/18144891/new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-marijuana-legalization) (a position he adopted recently, after being challenged by Cynthia Nixon in the 2018 Democratic primary), as well as other progressive moves, like a pledge to make New York[  carbon neutral](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/12/17/cuomo-sets-goal-for-carbon-neutral-electric-system-by-2040-751133) (although not until 2040), an end to[  vacancy decontrol](https://therealdeal.com/2018/12/18/cuomo-vows-to-end-vacancy-decontrol/), and[  electoral reform](https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2018/12/18/andrew-cuomo-call-for-an-election-day-holiday-surprises-even-voting-reform-advocates) (although he called for that last year too). Although the Governor's platform had a number of apparent progressive platforms, he refused to increase taxes on the wealthy, did not commit to supporting the New York Health Act, and also called to make his[  property tax cap](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/rochester/politics/2018/12/18/cuomo-wants-a-permanent-property-tax-cap) permanent.
-   Following the Governor's speech, Mayor de Blasio officially [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/nyregion/marijuana-nyc-de-blasio-legalize.html) his support for legalizing recreational marijuana.
-   Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen announced that she is[  leaving](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2018/12/19/alicia-glen-who-oversaw-de-blasios-affordable-housing-plan-and-embattled-nycha-to-depart-city-hall-760480) the de Blasio administration early next year. A former Goldman Sachs executive, Glen's role included overseeing the Mayor's housing plan, private-sector job growth, and NYCHA, among other things.
-   Six incoming Democratic State Senators representing NYC have released a statement in support of[  congestion pricing](https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/12/19/incoming-state-senators-say-they-support-congestion-pricing-but/), which will likely be put to a contentious debate in the Legislature in early 2019.
-   Outgoing Public Advocate Tish James released her final[  "Worst Landlords"](http://gothamist.com/2018/12/19/ladies_gentleman_your_worst_landlor.php) List, putting NYCHA on top after a year of turmoil for the agency.
-   The Riders Alliance wants Mayor De Blasio to do more to promote the[  Fair Fares](https://brooklyneagle.com/articles/2018/12/19/riders-alliance-pushes-de-blasio-to-release-fair-fares-plan/) program that begins in January.

He resigned from a leadership role on Jumaane Williams' Public Advocate campaign after he was met with opprobrium.
