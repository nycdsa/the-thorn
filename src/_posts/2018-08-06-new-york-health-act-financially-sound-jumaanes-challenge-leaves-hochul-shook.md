---

## Local News:
-   A new study by the RAND Corporation has[  determined](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/08/01/rand-study-finds-single-payer-viable-in-new-york-but-with-big-caveats-536072) that the New York Health Act (NYHA) would likely be financially feasible and lead to long-term healthcare spending savings across the State. NYHA would establish a single-payer healthcare system in New York State.

-   Governor Cuomo[  announced](http://gothamist.com/2018/08/03/marijuana_legalize_ny_cuomo.php) that recreational marijuana legalization would be considered in an upcoming legislative session. He[  timed](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/on-air/as-seen-on/Cuomo-Forms-Panel-to-Draft-Legal-Weed-Bill_New-York-489936611.html) the announcement to distract from bad press about corruption, following a trend. Manhattan DA Cy Vance, who said in May that his office would stop[  prosecuting](http://gothamist.com/2018/08/01/manhattan_marijuana_policy.php) nearly all marijuana cases, claims the policy is now in effect.

-   The Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), an independent police accountability commission that has virtually no capacity to enforce disciplinary recommendations, is[  lobbying](http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/7835-nypd-watchdog-seeks-sharper-teeth-through-charter-revision) to include an expansion of the board's powers as part of the City's charter revisions. The Mayor's commission is due to put out its final report and proposed ballot measures for this year's general election in early September, while a second commission plans to release its own proposals in time for next year's election.

-   NYPD is[  refusing](https://www.amny.com/news/fare-evasion-nypd-1.20215200?mc_cid=c76b01f944&mc_eid=c6cb0a150f) to comply with a law passed by City Council that requires the release of demographic data related to fare evasion arrests, which would likely reveal racist enforcement patterns.

-   In accordance with a federal HUD order, smoking indoors in NYCHA buildings is now[  banned](http://gothamist.com/2018/07/30/nycha_smoking_ban_nyc.php). Enforcement of this ban could lead to eviction.

-   As they did successfully in 2015 when similar regulation was on the table, Uber and Lyft are going on an all-out [offensive](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/nyregion/uber-nyc-cap-city-council.html) to convince the City Council to kill a ride share cap. Uber is reported to have called customers directly to get them to[  lobby](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/amberjamieson/uber-phone-calls-riders-new-york-city-council) their Council Members by saying "I support Uber" and hanging up.

-   Documents obtained from the Bronx DA's office show how it has been[  systematically](https://theappeal.org/internal-documents-reveal-how-bronx-prosecutors-are-taught-to-slow-down-cases/) delaying prosecutions and undermining New York's speedy trial law.

-   After Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez (District 10, Upper Manhattan) secured two key City Council votes to approve a rezoning in Inwood, community members [organized](http://gothamist.com/2018/08/03/protesters_inwood_city_council.php) large protests ahead of the final vote on August 8.

-   A white supremacist group[  unfurled](http://gothamist.com/2018/07/31/fort_tryon_park_hate_group.php) a racist banner in Fort Tryon Park last weekend.

## Elections:

-   The NY Post editorial board is[  scared](https://nypost.com/2018/07/31/for-all-his-antics-jumaane-williams-could-still-win/) that Jumaane Williams will win this September's Democratic primary for Lieutenant Governor. The incumbent, Kathy Hochul, is aggressively [campaigning](http://www.gothamgazette.com/state/7838-in-wide-open-lieutenant-governor-primary-hochul-targets-votes-in-williams-backyard) for votes in NYC and [attacking](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/While-Cuomo-ignores-opponent-Hochul-goes-on-the-13101584.php) Williams in evident recognition of his strong challenge.

-   Cuomo [accepted](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/nyregion/cuomo-independence-line-ballot-governor-election.html) the endorsement of the Independence Party of New York and will appear on their ballot line this November. The Independence Party has also endorsed upstate Republican Congress Members that Cuomo claims to oppose.

-   A new [poll](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/nyregion/cuomo-nixon-lead-primary.html) showed a significant lead for Cuomo over Cynthia Nixon in September's gubernatorial primary, but it may have [under-sampled](https://twitter.com/LaurenHitt/status/1024271243275653120) younger voters.

-   Two court cases brought by entrenched Democratic State Senate incumbents began in Kings County Supreme Court to try to throw their opponents off of the ballot. Martin Dilan (District 18, North Brooklyn) [challenged](https://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/41/32/pl-inside-politics-2018-08-03-bk.html) Julia Salazar's residency history, and Simcha Felder (District 17, Borough Park) [challenged](http://gothamist.com/2018/08/03/simcha_felder_blake_morris.php) the legality of Blake Morris' listed name.
