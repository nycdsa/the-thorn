-   Both candidates in the 18th State Senate District race (North Brooklyn) received significant national attention: NYC DSA-endorsee Julia Salazar for her platforms related to both[  technology](https://www.salon.com/2018/08/13/exclusive-democratic-socialists-of-america-backed-candidate-julia-salazar-challenges-silicon-valley/) and[  sex workers' rights](https://theintercept.com/2018/08/17/julia-salazar-sex-workers-rights/); and her opponent, incumbent Martin Dilan, for his use of[  contributions](http://www.gothamgazette.com/state/7863-dilan-opponents-question-past-financial-support-from-idc) from an IDC slush fund that has now been ruled to be illegal.
