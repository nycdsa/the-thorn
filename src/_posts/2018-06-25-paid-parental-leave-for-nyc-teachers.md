## Local News:

-   Union officials have struck a deal with the City to grant [paid parental leave](http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2018/06/20/new-york-city-teachers-to-get-paid-parental-leave-city-announces) to public school employees, starting with the 2018-19 school year.

-   The new City budget, agreed to last week, [contains](http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/7756-city-council-push-for-budget-transparency-falls-far-short) only five of the 123 new units of appropriation requested by the City Council in the name of transparency.

-   Both the State and City governments took baby steps toward legalizing cannabis: Cuomo's State Department of Health released a report (whose timeline was magically sped up thanks to the gubernatorial primary) that [recommended](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/nyregion/new-york-marijuana-legalization.html) full legalization, though it is [unlikely](http://gothamist.com/2018/06/18/ny_marijuana_legalization.php) that a bill will be passed in 2018. And de Blasio announced that the NYPD will [shift](http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/393102-de-blasio-announces-nypd-will-no-longer-arrest-people-for-smoking-weed) from arrests to summonses for smoking in public. However, the NYPD's enforcement shift is [unlikely](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pol-pot-arrest-summons-20180620-story.html) to fully prevent arrests and overpolicing of marijuana violations in communities of color.

-   Council Member Mark Gjonaj (District 13, East Bronx), who poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into his own election campaign last year, appears to have [earmarked](http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180622/POLITICS/180629969/bronx-councilman-mark-gjonaj-gives-his-nonprofit-130k-in-taxpayer-funds) $130,000 of city money for his former nonprofit in this year's budget.

-   Legislation to [extend](https://ny.curbed.com/2018/6/21/17488928/nyc-speed-cameras-school-zone-legislation-expire) the life of NYC's speed camera program died in the State Senate thanks to opposition by Senator Simcha Felder, Republicans, the [Patrolmen's Benevolent Association](https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2018/06/19/which-matters-more-to-albany-saving-lives-or-collecting-campaign-cash-from-the-pba/), and inaction by Governor Cuomo. The cameras are proven to decrease speeding in locations where they have been placed.

-   The New York State Senate passed a bill that, if enacted, would allow members of the [public](http://www.gothamgazette.com/state/7750-passed-by-senate-bill-would-allow-public-to-call-state-agency-hearings) to call for state agency hearings.

-   Gothamist [detailed](http://gothamist.com/2018/06/19/mcc_jail_human_rights_torture.php) the atrocious conditions of the Manhattan Correctional Center, a federal prison near City Hall in downtown Manhattan.

-   Though the NYPD's policy of Stop and Frisk is supposedly a thing of the past, a pervasive culture of [discriminatory](https://citylimits.org/2018/06/21/stop-and-frisk-is-over-but-low-level-nypd-encounters-now-raise-concerns/) stops continues in the form of lower-level, unreported encounters.

-   City records show that 466 students attending City schools after arriving in the US as unaccompanied minors were arrested and [detained by ICE](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/ny-metro-feds-keep-city-schools-in-the-dark-about-detaining-kids-20180621-story.html) between October 2017 and March 2018, an increase from 24 the previous year. The students were in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for providing unaccompanied minors with services like education.
