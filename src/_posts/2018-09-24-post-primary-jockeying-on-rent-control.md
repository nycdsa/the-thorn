## Elections:
-   A pair of articles examine Julia Salazar's primary victory in last week's primary: DSA member Annie Shields highlights Salazar's unabashedly democratic socialist platform and NYC-DSA's substantial field operation in [The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/the-reason-julia-salazar-won/), and NYC-DSA co-chairs Bianca Cunningham and Abdullah Younus write in the [Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-salazar-dsa-20180921-story.html) that Julia Salazar is just the beginning.
-   City Limits conducted a [post-mortem](https://citylimits.org/2018/09/20/a-post-mortem-on-the-cynthia-campaign-lots-of-prep-not-enough-money/) of Cynthia Nixon's gubernatorial run with the campaign's chief strategist, highlighting a lack of funds.

-   No longer running for public office, Ross Barkan [penned](http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-which-cuomo-will-we-see-in-2019-story.html) an op-ed for the Daily News highlighting the potential for Cuomo to either enact progressive reforms or kill them in 2019.
