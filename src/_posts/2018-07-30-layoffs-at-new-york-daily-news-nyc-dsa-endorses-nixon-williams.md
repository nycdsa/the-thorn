Governor Andrew Cuomo responded by [offering](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/statement-governor-andrew-m-cuomo-offering-state-help-avert-new-york-daily-news-layoffs-0) Tronc, who just paid [$15 million](http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20180516/BLOGS10/180519919/why-oh-why-did-trib-parent-pay-ferro-15-million) to its ex-CEO who resigned in the wake of sexual harassment allegations, aid from New York State.

Elections:
-   New York City DSA [endorsed](https://twitter.com/Devinitelybk/status/1023653133027823616?s=19) Cynthia Nixon for Governor, and Jumaane Williams for Lieutenant Governor. The first [joint canvass](https://secure.ngpvan.com/JvFPSwiuu0WvxiEsiol_Gg2) with the Julia Salazar for State Senate campaign will be Tuesday, July 31 at 6pm.
-   State Senator Martin Dilan (District 18, Bushwick) is claiming that DSA-endorsed candidate Julia Salazar does not fulfill New York State's residency requirements to run for office, and [is suing](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pol-dilan-salazar-nixon-socialist-20180726-story.html) to have her removed from the ballot.
-   The state's top election enforcement body has ruled a campaign finance agreement between the Independence Party and now-former members of New York's IDC to be [improper](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Sugarman-cracks-down-on-former-IDC-campaign-13100468.php), and demanded that former IDC members return the funds rather than use them in this year's elections.
-   City Limits has a breakdown of Zellnor Myrie's bid to [replace ex-IDC member](https://citylimits.org/2018/07/24/big-themes-and-local-loyalties-in-central-brooklyn-senate-race/) Jesse Hamilton (District 20, Crown Heights) in the State Senate.

Despite being elected as a Democrat in 2012, Felcher has caucused with Republicans and in 2016 ran on all three of the Democratic, Republican, and Conservative ballot lines.
-   Candidate for State Senate Ross Barkan [criticized](http://www.gothamgazette.com/state/7821-in-democratic-senate-primary-barkan-criticizes-gounardes-for-embracing-anti-immigrant-reform-party-leader) his opponent in the District 22 (Bay Ridge, Marine Park) Democratic primary Andrew Gounardes for accepting the endorsement of the [Brooklyn Reform Party](http://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2018/7/26/reform-party-leader-bob-capano-factor-bay-ridge-democratic-primary).

-   Governor Cuomo told the Stonewall Democratic Club that he never "endorsed or financially supported" any IDC members, despite [definitely doing that](https://theintercept.com/2018/07/25/andrew-cuomo-tells-stonewall-democrats-he-never-backed-idc-or-anti-lgbt-candidates-which-is-preposterous/). The Stonewall Club endorsed him anyway.
