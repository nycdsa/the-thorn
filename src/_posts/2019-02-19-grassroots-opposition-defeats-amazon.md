---

## Local News:
-   In a company [blog post](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/update-on-plans-for-new-york-city-headquarters), Amazon officials announced they are [cancelling](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/nyregion/amazon-hq2-queens.html) plans to set up "HQ2" in Long Island City, citing opposition from local electeds and profusely complimenting Cuomo and De Blasio. Amazon's retreat is a [testament](https://theintercept.com/2019/02/15/amazon-nyc-hq2/) to the power of grassroots anti-capitalist organizing and the [unpopularity](http://gothamist.com/2019/02/15/amazon_cuomo_albany_democrats.php) of Cuomo's economic development strategy of offering cash incentives in exchange for "job creation." Real estate developers are [mad](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-pullout-from-queens-n-y-stuns-real-estate-industry-11550182281) about it.
-   State Senator Julia Salazar (District 18, Bushwick) [penned](https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/opinion/opinion/julia-salazar-campaign-finance-reform.html) a City & State op-ed calling for comprehensive campaign finance reform that includes statewide public financing. City & State also [published](https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/personality/interviews-profiles/julia-salazar-isnt-taking-back-seat-2019.html) a short profile of Salazar in which she describes her experience in the state legislature and her priorities going forward.
-   Council Members Carlina Rivera (District 2, Lower East Side) and Keith Powers (District 4, East Midtown) have [proposed](https://ny.curbed.com/2019/2/13/18223186/broker-fees-new-york-legislation) a bill that would limit brokers fees and security deposits to one month of rent.
-   As punishment for Council Member Rubén Díaz, Sr.'s (District 18, Castle Hill) homophobic remarks last week, Council Speaker Corey Johnson [eliminated](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2019/02/13/johnson-faces-skeptical-questions-about-his-decision-to-eliminate-diazs-committee-852892) the Committee on For-Hire Vehicles, which he previously established in a deal with the Bronx Democratic machine so that Díaz could have a committee chairmanship when he was elected to the Council in 2017. The rapid formation and elimination of the committee, and the extent to which Díaz was tolerated and promoted by prominent NYC Democrats after years of consistent homophobia and sexism, raises [questions](http://gothamist.com/2019/02/13/ruben_diaz_sr_homophobia.php) about the sincerity of these actions, as well as festering social conservatism from other prominent leaders in the Bronx Democratic machine.
-   New York State Democratic Party officials are allegedly plotting to [eliminate](https://theintercept.com/2019/02/09/ocasio-cortez-district-redistricting-2020/) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's congressional district in the redistricting that will occur after the 2020 census.

## Elections:
-   Mayor de Blasio is apparently [serious](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2019/02/11/de-blasio-heads-to-new-hampshire-as-he-contemplates-run-for-president-848323) about running for president.
-   The NY Post [covered](https://nypost.com/2019/02/10/nycs-democratic-socialists-enlist-da-tiffany-caban/) DSA's endorsement of Tiffany Cabán for Queens DA.
-   The Queens Democratic Party, still chaired by Joe Crowley, has [endorsed](https://queenseagle.com/all/2019/2/11/queens-democrats-set-to-endorse-katz-dsa-backs-cabn) Borough President Melinda Katz in June's Democratic primary for Queens DA. Katz beat out Council Member Rory Lancman (District 24, Fresh Meadows) and Judge Gregory Lasak, who are seen as the other establishment choices for DA.
-   Mina Malik, a former prosecutor who also served as the director of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, has officially [entered](https://queenseagle.com/all/2019/2/12/former-queens-prosecutor-malik-officially-enters-da-race) the race for Queens DA.
