-   The charter revision commission, tasked with making recommendations for changes to the city charter to improve civic engagement, has initiated a series of public hearings to solicit public input. Voting reform advocates and elected officials are [pushing](http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/7650-elected-officials-advocates-push-for-instant-runoff-voting) the commission and the Mayor to include instant-runoff voting, also known as ranked-choice voting, as one of the proposals the commission could put on the ballot in November.

Meanwhile, Council Speaker Corey Johnson openly [regrets](https://nypost.com/2018/05/01/council-speaker-we-should-have-imposed-limits-on-uber/) folding under pressure from Uber lobbyists in 2015, when de Blasio first attempted to cap the for-hire vehicle industry while it had half as many cars on the streets as it does now.
-   The State Assembly [passed](http://beta.nydailynews.com/news/politics/n-y-approves-gender-neutral-titles-fire-police-jobs-article-1.3966824) a bill to use gender neutral terms for police officers and firefighters in State law.

-   Gothamist has coverage of [May Day](http://gothamist.com/2018/05/02/photos_may_day_nyc_2018.php) events, including quotes from NYC-DSA Steering Committee member Erin Neff.
-   The Vera Institute of Justice published a [report ](https://www.vera.org/publications/medical-parole-new-york-state?utm_source=In+Justice+Today+Newsletter&utm_campaign=32531dc91c-&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0331e33901-32531dc91c-58249847)about medical parole in New York state, concluding that a "broad, permissive statute is not enough to ensure that people with serious illnesses and incapacitating medical conditions are successfully identified, processed, and released in a timely manner." Between 2013-2017, 476 people imprisoned in New York applied for compassionate release. During that time, 143 applicants died in custody.
-   Gov. Cuomo has formally directed State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to [investigate](https://abcnews.go.com/US/ny-police-prosecutors-investigation-handling-harvey-weinstein-allegations/story?id=54877591) how the NYPD and Manhattan DA's office handled the sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein. The Marshall Project found Vance to be far more [punitive](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/04/29/the-people-vs-cy-vance?ref=hp-1-100) than the DAs of other boroughs when prosecuting low-income defendants.
-   Despite a pledge by Mayor de Blasio in 2015 that City courthouses would be equipped with "easily accessible ATMs," courthouses in the Bronx, Staten Island, and Queens do not provide [access](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/nyregion/nyc-bail-atm-rikers.html) to them during criminal hearings, making it difficult for defendants to pay cash bail even in cases when they can afford it.

Nixon's pro-tenant stances have caused deep[  concern](https://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/the-nightmare-candidate-for-new-york-real-estate/) in New York's real estate industry and developers and landlords are  openly attempting to keep her from either winning the Democratic nomination for Governor or moving Cuomo to the left on housing policy.
