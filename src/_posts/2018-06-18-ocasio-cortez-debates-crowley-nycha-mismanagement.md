## Local News
-   Federal prosecutors [accused](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/nyregion/new-york-city-housing-authority-lead-paint.html) the City of systematically mismanaging NYCHA, and negotiated a settlement with the de Blasio administration to substantially increase funding and oversight.

-   The Assembly [passed](http://assembly.state.ny.us/Press/files/20180612.php) the remaining bills constituting a comprehensive package of criminal justice reform that was introduced this year. Included among these bills are critical legislation for the reform of the monetary bail system; the HALT Act, which would greatly curtail the use of solitary confinement; and a criminal discovery reform bill that protects the rights of people accused of crimes to have early and automatic access to the evidence in their cases.

-   The City Council's Committee on Public Safety, chaired by Donovan Richards (D-Queens), held hearings on the use of the NYPD ["gang" database](http://gothamist.com/2018/06/13/nypd_gang_database_nyc.php) which, according to data given to The Intercept, has [grown by 70%](https://theintercept.com/2018/06/11/new-york-gang-database-expanded-by-70-percent-under-mayor-bill-de-blasio/) under Mayor De Blasio. Advocates for criminal justice reform point out that the broad, vague, and secretive nature of the database is an assault on civil liberties.

The Mayor is aiming to reform the specialized high school entrance exam to expand representation of Black and Latinx students at nine specialized public high schools including Brooklyn Tech.

-   As a result of a NY Attorney General investigation into lead exposure, New York City reached a settlement with the federal government to spend [over $2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennawang/2018/06/14/new-york-city-housing-authority-culpable-for-massive-health-violations-lead-poisoning/#3aa6bfd722ad) on NYCHA, with the first $1 billion spent over the next four years, and $200 million per year after that.

-   The NYC City Council [passed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/nyregion/new-york-city-budget-subway-fares.html) the city budget on Monday, including funding for discounted MTA fares for residents below the federal poverty line.

-   A Sienna College poll released last week shows Andrew Cuomo holding a [35 point](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/nyregion/cuomo-cynthia-nixon-poll.html) lead over Cynthia Nixon.

-   Mayor de Blasio's Charter Revision Commission, tasked with finding ways to improve the city's voting, election, and campaign finance processes, and presenting them to voters as a ballot initiative in the November General Election, [convened](http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/7733-mayoral-charter-revision-commission-hears-expert-testimony-on-voting-and-elections) this week. Among the those heard were five proposals from the city's Campaign Finance Board to [improve](http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/7744-mayor-charter-revision-commission-hears-expert-testimony-on-campaign-finance-reform) New York's widely lauded campaign finance program.

-   Housing activists [marched](http://bedfordandbowery.com/2018/06/cynthia-nixon-joins-march-against-cuomos-housing-policies-as-guv-gets-master-builder-award/) from the New York Public Library's main branch to an event where Cuomo was receiving a "master builder" award. Gubernatorial and lieutenant gubernatorial candidates Cynthia Nixon and Jumaane Williams [joined](https://patch.com/new-york/midtown-nyc/thousands-protest-cuomos-housing-policies-nypl-main-branch) the pre-march rally to call out Cuomo's failures on affordable housing and the state's homelessness crisis.
