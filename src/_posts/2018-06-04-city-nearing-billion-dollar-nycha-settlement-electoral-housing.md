## In-Depth: Lessons from a Joint Housing and Electoral Canvass

*By Cea Weaver, Colin Vanderburg, and Asher Ross*

Last Saturday in Bushwick, the Housing Working Group and Electoral Working Group teamed up for a joint canvass for universal rent control and Julia Salazar's campaign for State Senate.

Twenty volunteers knocked on over 850 doors in Senate District 18. Experienced housing canvassers were paired with electoral volunteers so that the latter could observe the language and content used, and housing canvassers could see general canvassing best practices from electoral volunteers.

We hope to replicate Saturday's canvass throughout the summer. As socialists, our goal is to build working-class power---whether at the polls, in our homes, or in our workplaces. New York tenants are a millions-strong constituency that cuts across lines of race, class, gender, and age. Many of us may vote as workers, students, or parents, but if we unite as tenants, we represent an unstoppable political force in New York City.

This is where DSA can play a vital role. Over 40 percent of our members live in buildings alongside rent-stabilized tenants, making this campaign a fight for our own homes and neighborhoods. Tens of thousands of rent-stabilized units---the city's single biggest source of affordable housing---disappear each year as landlords and developers use every trick in the book to deregulate apartments, often by harassing and evicting longtime residents. The struggle for universal rent control is part of a broader vision for decommodifying the basic human needs---from housing to healthcare to education---that capitalism preys on for profit.

This is particularly important in Senate District 18, which includes some of the most rapidly gentrifying parts of Brooklyn. In New York, [tenant protections (like many other issues) are decided at the State level](https://thethorn.nyc/posts/city-agrees-to-divest-from-fossil-fuels-nyc-rent-laws/), which is why it's so important for socialists to think about taking statewide office. Senate District 18, where Julia Salazar is running, is home to thousands of working-class immigrants and people of color who are facing displacement as real estate speculators seek to buy and flip apartments that should be rent-stabilized. Living conditions in rent-stabilized buildings are deteriorating as landlords withhold services as a means of forcing people out. Rent control is the strongest tool we have to fight gentrification. Julia Salazar is a socialist and a tenant, and is running for office to strengthen tenants' rights in New York State.

**Here are some lessons from our joint canvass:**

1.  Data is important. When planning our canvass, we targeted buildings we had marked as in distress, based on their high number of code violations or other signs that the landlord was trying to displace long-term residents. Many of the people we talked to were thus already agitated on the issue because of their own pressing situation, and were enthusiastic to hear about a candidate who is taking it on.

2.  Lead with the issue. Once we made the lift of the housing agitation, it was very easy to sell voting for Julia---and the expiring rent stabilization laws helped add context to the importance of the election. It was easier to approach people about an issue that deeply affects them, and follow with the candidate, than to simply sell people on a candidate. But it was also more effective than approaching a person about an issue alone, as the electoral ask sharpens the issue and presents a concrete alternative. Tenants in New York City---like you---are in trouble, and Julia Salazar has a plan to do something about it.

3.  Follow-up matters. We were doing a joint canvass to talk to voters about Julia Salazar, but also to promote a Tenant Town Hall on June 5th for people interested in joining our campaign for universal rent control. It was difficult to get solid yesses for an event ten days in advance; in order to turn the contacts we meet on the doors into participating members of DSA, we must commit to follow-up visits and/or phone calls.
