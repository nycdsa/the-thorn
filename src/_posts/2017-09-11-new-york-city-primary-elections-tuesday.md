## Elections
-   Candidate for the District 43 (Bay Ridge) City Council seat and DSA Endorsee Khader El-Yateem received significant media attention from major outlets this week including [The Village Voice](https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/09/05/khader-el-yateem-could-be-the-first-socialist-palestinian-pastor-on-the-city-council/), [The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/meet-the-socialist-who-hopes-to-become-new-yorks-first-arab-american-elected-official/), and [WNYC](http://www.wnyc.org/story/outsider-tries-crash-democratic-party/).
-   Candidates for the D. 35 (Crown Heights) City Council seat, including DSA endorsee Jabari Brisport who will be involved in a Green Party primary this Tuesday, [met for a candidate forum this past week](http://www.kingscountypolitics.com/cumbo-fox-supporters-get-final-shots-primary/).
-   Carlos Menchaca, who has been one of the more progressive voices on City Council, is an incumbent facing a rare competitive primary in D. 38 (Sunset Park). The [candidates met for forums twice in the final week](http://www.kingscountypolitics.com/38th-council-candidates-debate-climate-change-effect-jobs-development/) before the primary election.
-   Candidate for the D. 41 (Brownsville) City Council Seat Alicka Amprey-Samuel [received an endorsement from Bill De Blasio](http://www.kingscountypolitics.com/samuel-nabs-de-blasio-endorsement-week-primary/) but [made sure to voice that she would not be a "rubber stamp"](http://www.kingscountypolitics.com/ampry-samuel-refutes-shell-rubber-stamp-de-blasio/) for the Mayor should she win the position.
-   The candidates in the closely watched race for Brooklyn District Attorney, including acting DA Eric Gonzalez who [continues to gain high profile endorsements](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/04/opinion/editorials/Eric-Gonzalez-for-Brooklyn-District-Attorney.html), met for a [final debate](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/brooklyn-district-attorney-hopefuls-clash-debate-article-1.3472648) that was [broadcast by NY1](http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2017/09/5/candidates-in-brooklyn-da-democratic-primary-slug-it-out-in-ny1-debate.html).
-   In other Brooklyn DA race news, public defenders in Brooklyn claim that Gonzalez's April memo urging reduced bail requests, which the Times cited in its endorsement, [hasn't resulted in any meaningful changes](https://citylimits.org/2017/09/05/observers-brooklyn-da-still-pushes-for-bail-too-often/). And [candidate Marc Fliedner's membership in DSA](https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/09/08/marc-fliedner-wants-to-be-brooklyns-dsa-d-a/) was touted in [multiple articles](https://mic.com/articles/184026/how-one-da-candidate-in-a-crowded-race-is-trying-to-shape-the-future-of-criminal-justice-reform#.dsz1l2YPY).
-   In Upper Manhattan, two-term incumbent and candidate for Council Speaker, Ydanis Rodriguez (District 10, Inwood), faces [electoral heat over the rezoning facing the district](https://citylimits.org/2017/09/10/at-heated-inwood-debate-rezoning-is-central-contention/).
-   Rafael Salamanca Jr.'s reelection race in D. 17 (Hunts Point), in which [he holds a commanding fundraising advantage](https://citylimits.org/2017/09/09/tested-by-four-races-in-18-months-councilman-has-large-cash-advantage/), shows that even the City's generous matching funds are often insufficient in the City's poorer neighborhoods.
-   In Queens, Hiram Monseratte, who was [convicted of stealing City funds and expelled from the State Senate for domestic violence](http://gothamist.com/2017/09/06/hiram_monseratte_resurrection.php), may actually win the seat for D. 21 (College Point).
-   Bill De Blasio and Sal Albanese had their [second and final Mayoral Primary debate](http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/09/06/de-blasio-and-albanese-spar-ahead-of-primary-election-next-week-114340) on Wednesday.
-   Candidates for civil court judgeships generally run unopposed at the primary level. This year's Kings County Democratic race is different as a [slate of five independent Democrats is running against the chosen candidates](https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/08/10/insurgent-campaigns-aim-to-shake-up-brooklyn-judicial-races/) of the Democratic County Committee. Additional information on the[ candidates can be found here](https://citylimits.org/2017/09/07/in-brooklyn-a-rare-contest-for-civil-court-judge/).

District Leaders make important decisions about candidates for judgeships, as well as who will fill ballot lines in certain special elections, such as the [recent departures of New York State Senator Daniel Squadron](http://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2017/8/10/political-insiders-will-pick-sen-squadrons-successor-and-brooklyn-may-not-have) and Assemblymember Denny Farrell.
-   The Daily News, who [were just sold to Tronc](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/05/548628995/publisher-tronc-to-purchase-new-yorks-daily-news), have released endorsements for a number of candidates throughout the city, including Laurie Cumbo, Justin Brannan, and the openly homophobic Ruben Diaz, Sr. in the Bronx. Their endorsements are broken down by borough, for [Brooklyn](http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/council-picks-brooklyn-article-1.3461975), [Queens](http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/daily-news-city-council-picks-queens-article-1.3461954), [Manhattan](http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/daily-news-city-council-picks-manhattan-article-1.3461978), and [the Bronx](http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/daily-news-city-council-picks-bronx-article-1.3461996).
