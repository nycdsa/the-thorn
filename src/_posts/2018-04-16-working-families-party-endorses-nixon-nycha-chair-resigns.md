## Elections
-   The Working Families Party (WFP) [endorsed](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/04/wfp-endorses-nixon-despite-pressure-from-cuomo.html) Cynthia Nixon for Governor and Jumaane Williams for Lieutenant Governor. After a slew of grassroots organizations affiliated with WFP including Make the Road and New York Communities for Change [endorsed](https://splinternews.com/everyone-loves-cynthia-nixon-including-new-yorks-large-1825244240) Nixon, major unions allied with Governor Cuomo [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/nyregion/cuomo-nixon-wfp-labor-governor-election.html) their departure from WFP, threatening the organization's finances and structure. Furthermore, Cuomo [indicated](https://nypost.com/2018/04/13/cuomo-campaign-gives-up-on-winning-working-families-party-endorsement/) that he would not even seek the WFP endorsement, and [threatened](http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/21070/cuomo_nixon_working_families_party_new_york_unions) community organizations that endorsed Nixon over him.

If Nixon loses the Democratic primary, it is still unclear if she will remain on the WFP line in the general election, but there is a distinct possibility of having two left wing challengers to Cuomo on the ballot in November.
