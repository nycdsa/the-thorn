Silver took money from two real estate developers and a cancer researcher, and took official actions both to benefit them, and to further enrich himself, during his tenure in the Assembly.
-   New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman [resigned](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eric-schneiderman-abuse-allegations-manhattan-da-probe-claims-new-york-attorney-general/) after multiple allegations of abuse against women.
