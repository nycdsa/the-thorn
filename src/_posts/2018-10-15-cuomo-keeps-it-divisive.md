So far, Avella is the only former IDC member who lost in September to stay in the race, although Jeff Klein is [sitting](http://www.gothamgazette.com/state/7973-klein-filing-late-post-primary-shows-over-3-million-in-senate-campaign-spending) on over a half million dollars and has not made any announcements since the primary.
