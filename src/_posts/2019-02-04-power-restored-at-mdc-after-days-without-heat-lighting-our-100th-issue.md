## Local News:

-   Electrical failures at the [Metropolitan Detention Center](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/nyregion/brooklyn-federal-jail-heat.html) in Sunset Park left inmates with little access to heat or hot water during the coldest week of the winter so far. As of 7 p.m. Sunday, the lights were [back on](https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/criminal-justice/2019/02/04/power-restored-to-metropolitan-detention-center-in-brooklyn) and there was regular heat inside the building, but there was no hot water.

-   The City and the federal government reached a deal that will see HUD [take more control](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/nyregion/hud-nycha-deal.html?mc_cid=1b2bbea719&mc_eid=c6cb0a150f) of NYCHA while stopping short of a full federal takeover. The new agreement comes after a federal judge [rejected](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/nyregion/nycha-settlement-court-ruling.html?module=inline&mc_cid=1b2bbea719&mc_eid=c6cb0a150f) an earlier deal in November as insufficient.

-   NYCHA's Red Hook Houses remain dangerously [vulnerable](https://www.thenation.com/article/new-york-climate-change-public-housing/) if another storm like Hurricane Sandy hits the City.

-   Senator Julia Salazar (District 18, North Brooklyn) [proposed](https://therealdeal.com/2019/01/30/sen-julia-salazars-new-eviction-bill-is-the-first-step-toward-universal-rent-control/) a bill that would require landlords in market-rate housing to provide justification to raise rents more than 3.3%, effectively protecting all New York tenants from exorbitant rent increases.

-   An Amazon executive told a City Council hearing that he would [oppose](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pol-amazon-city-council-union-workers-20190130-story.html) unionization efforts by workers at the proposed HQ2 campus. Meanwhile, the Teamsters joined the coalition against Amazon's NYC plans, and even Cuomo's office made a [statement](https://gizmodo.com/teamsters-join-coalition-against-hq2-as-amazon-doubles-1832206048) criticizing Amazon's unionization stance.

-   Lyft and Juno have [sued](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/31/18205579/new-york-lyft-uber-drivers-pay-raise) to block a minimum wage law that benefits NYC FHV drivers.

-   City Limits looked at the [effects](https://citylimits.org/2019/01/30/does-less-policing-more-fare-beating-on-new-york-city-subways/) of the decision by the Manhattan DA's office to stop prosecuting turnstile jumping, on both the MTA and the criminal justice system

-   A [report](https://www.independentpanelreportnypd.net/assets/report.pdf) highlighting key problems with the NYPD discipline system was issued by a panel of former federal prosecutors and a former federal judge (the panel was appointed by NYPD Commissioner O'Neill to review NYPD discipline).

## Elections:

-   Corey Johnson has already announced that he's considering [running](https://therealdeal.com/2019/01/28/council-speaker-corey-johnson-weighs-mayoral-run-refuses-contributions-from-developers/) for mayor in 2021. Johnson committed on T[witter](https://twitter.com/CoreyinNYC/status/1089883097112424448) to refuse individual donations over $250, and will accept "zero" money from real estate developers, lobbyists, or PACs.

-   The final count of [candidates](https://bklyner.com/alas-the-final-count-for-the-upcoming-public-advocates-race-is-17/) to qualify for the ballot in the February 26 Public Advocate special election is 17.

-   The City Council is [moving](http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/8249-city-council-seeks-expanded-power-sweeping-change-in-recommendations-to-charter-revision-commission) forward on its charter revision proposals which will be placed on the ballot in this November's general election. Current indications suggest that it will support referendums on increased Council power in NYPD and CCRB appointments, ranked choice voting, and more.

-   Last year's electoral victories by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Alessandra Biaggi have helped [empower](https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-city/rumble-in-the-bronx.html) opposition to the entrenched powers of the Bronx Democratic Party.

-   Council Members Brad Lander (District 39, Park Slope) and Helen Rosenthal (District 6, Upper West Side) have [declared](http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/8228-2021-comptroller-race-now-features-two-city-council-members) their intentions to run for Comptroller in 2021. Along with other borough and citywide races, the field may balloon due to the vast majority of sitting council members who will be term-limited in two years.

-   Assembly Member and Public Advocate candidate Michael Blake (District 79, Morrisania) [consulted](https://m.timesunion.com/news/article/Rising-star-assemblyman-Blake-says-he-didn-t-need-13580855.php) for a Bermudan political party for two years without registering as a "foreign agent" under federal law.
