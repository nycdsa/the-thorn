-   The Right to Know Act, one of the most significant pieces of police reform legislation in recent memory, went into effect on Friday. However, there are [concerns](http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/8004-questions-linger-as-right-to-know-act-goes-into-effect) from advocates about the Mayor and NYPD's seriousness in complying with its directives, which were already watered down by the City Council in late 2017.
-   The Mayor's plans to replace the boilers and upgrade heating systems in NYCHA buildings is [behind schedule](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-metro-nycha-heat-outage-fix-plan-20181018-story.html), with some in the De Blasio Administration blaming the HUD Department for the delay.

-   Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer has launched a campaign to [defeat](http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/8000-brewer-creates-committee-to-oppose-charter-revision-proposals) two of the three City Charter questions that the Mayor's commission put on the ballot in November.
-   Former Comptroller John Liu appears to be the front-runner in November's District 11 State Senate (Northeast Queens) race, but faces [Tony Avella](http://gothamist.com/2018/10/16/tony_avella_john_liu_election.php), who refuses to back down from a third party challenge, and an openly [racist](http://gothamist.com/2018/10/17/paladino_queens_proud_boys.php) Republican challenger.
-   Joe Crowley [received](https://www.crainsnewyork.com/politics/contributions-dated-2022-may-give-clue-crowleys-future) new political contributions dated for the year 2022, a suggestion that he may be interested in running again for Congress once district lines are redrawn in response to the 2020 Census.
