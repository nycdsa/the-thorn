## Local News
-   Bill De Blasio presented his 2019 [budget](http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/7641-de-blasio-presents-89-billion-executive-budget-plan?mc_cid=b8b97e1817&mc_eid=1a9d72cbc4) proposal. Included was an additional $125 million for [854](https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2018/04/25/these-854-schools-stand-to-benefit-from-new-york-citys-125m-funding-boost/) NYC schools that De Blasio said were [underfunded](https://nypost.com/2018/04/25/de-blasio-announces-125m-in-school-funding-slams-cuomo/?mc_cid=2e5124485d&mc_eid=1a9d72cbc4) in the New York State budget. Missing was funding for the [Fair Fares](https://www.amny.com/transit/fair-fares-nyc-budget-1.18274685) program [supported](https://ny.curbed.com/2018/4/11/17221256/mta-fair-fares-city-council-response-mayor-de-blasio) by the majority of New York's City Council.
-   The Republican State Senate says it will no longer rush through Gov. Cuomo's [appointments](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/state-republicans-warn-cuomo-nominee-appointments-article-1.3949383), as it did last year with Cuomo's appointment of Joe Lhota to run the MTA.
-   The MTA released its [plan](http://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/mta-nyc-transit-unveils-comprehensive-plan-reimagine-bus-system-deliver?mc_cid=52a8dda33c&mc_eid=1a9d72cbc4) to overhaul New York City's [flagging](https://citylimits.org/2018/04/23/new-mta-plan-proposes-top-to-bottom-transformation-of-citys-sluggish-bus-system/) bus system.
-   The [executive order](https://injusticetoday.com/did-gov-cuomo-grant-new-york-parolees-the-right-to-vote-not-exactly-ed17ef0be52e) signed by Governor Cuomo to restore voting rights to parolees does not actually restore voting rights to parolees.
-   Meetings of the NYPD's ["Build the Block"](https://citylimits.org/2018/04/24/nypds-neighborhood-policing-meetings-arent-reaching-intended-audience/) initiative, which had a $3.5 million advertising budget that was primarily aimed at young people and communities skeptical of the police, have primarily attracted the same constituents already attending Community Board meetings and Precinct Council meetings: typically elderly residents, or BID representatives, complaining about parking or homelessness, and demanding more enforcement of petty crimes.
-   Former Black Panther and Black Liberation Army member Herman Bell has been [freed](https://freehermanbell.org/) on parole.
-   New NYC Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza [tweeted](https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2018/04/27/chancellor-richard-carranza-stands-by-his-tweet-of-viral-video-in-upper-west-side-integration-fight/) a video of Manhattan parents angrily opposing efforts to desegregate schools. The video was taken at a hearing on a plan to reserve spots in Upper West Side middle schools for students scoring below grade level.

The City Council passed a bill to create its own commission on reforming the charter, which it claims will be protected from conflicts of interest -- although the Mayor would still pick four members of that commission.
-   New York's Rent Guidelines Board passed a preliminary proposal to allow rent [increases](http://bedfordandbowery.com/2018/04/new-yorkers-demanding-a-rent-freeze-told-to-take-a-hike-board-votes-for-increases/) for the second year running on rent stabilized apartments.
