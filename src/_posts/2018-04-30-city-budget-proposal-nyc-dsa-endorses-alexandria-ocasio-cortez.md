Missing was funding for the [Fair Fares](https://www.amny.com/transit/fair-fares-nyc-budget-1.18274685) program [supported](https://ny.curbed.com/2018/4/11/17221256/mta-fair-fares-city-council-response-mayor-de-blasio) by the majority of New York's City Council.
-   The Republican State Senate says it will no longer rush through Gov. Cuomo's [appointments](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/state-republicans-warn-cuomo-nominee-appointments-article-1.3949383), as it did last year with Cuomo's appointment of Joe Lhota to run the MTA.
-   The MTA released its [plan](http://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/mta-nyc-transit-unveils-comprehensive-plan-reimagine-bus-system-deliver?mc_cid=52a8dda33c&mc_eid=1a9d72cbc4) to overhaul New York City's [flagging](https://citylimits.org/2018/04/23/new-mta-plan-proposes-top-to-bottom-transformation-of-citys-sluggish-bus-system/) bus system.
-   The [executive order](https://injusticetoday.com/did-gov-cuomo-grant-new-york-parolees-the-right-to-vote-not-exactly-ed17ef0be52e) signed by Governor Cuomo to restore voting rights to parolees does not actually restore voting rights to parolees.
-   Meetings of the NYPD's ["Build the Block"](https://citylimits.org/2018/04/24/nypds-neighborhood-policing-meetings-arent-reaching-intended-audience/) initiative, which had a $3.5 million advertising budget that was primarily aimed at young people and communities skeptical of the police, have primarily attracted the same constituents already attending Community Board meetings and Precinct Council meetings: typically elderly residents, or BID representatives, complaining about parking or homelessness, and demanding more enforcement of petty crimes.

The City Council passed a bill to create its own commission on reforming the charter, which it claims will be protected from conflicts of interest -- although the Mayor would still pick four members of that commission.
