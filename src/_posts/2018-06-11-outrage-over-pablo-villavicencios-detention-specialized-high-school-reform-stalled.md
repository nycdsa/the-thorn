## Local News

-   Pablo Villavicencio, who was detained by ICE at the Fort Hamilton Army Base while delivering pizza, was [granted](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-metro-pardoned-immigrant-offers-message-to-pizza-deliveryman-20180609-story.html) an emergency stay on his deportation proceedings.

-   The State Assembly Education Committee passed a plan supported by the De Blasio Administration to[  desegregate](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/ny-specialized-school-desegregation-20180606-story.html) the City's specialized high schools by setting aside seats for the top 7% of students at all City middle schools. Currently, a few "elite" middle schools receive a disproportionate share of admits to the specialized high schools. However, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie later announced that the Legislature would not [address](http://gothamist.com/2018/06/08/state_legislature_wont_address_spec.php) specialized high school desegregation until 2019.

-   ProPublica published a [feature](https://features.propublica.org/sanitation-salvage/sanitation-salvage-accidents-new-york-city-commercial-carting-garbage/) highlighting Sanitation Salvage, a private trash hauler that epitomizes the industry's reputation for dangerous working conditions and corrupt political connections.

-   A task force commissioned by the City Council [recommended](http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/7706-task-force-created-by-city-council-recommends-cuny-go-tuition-free) that CUNY go tuition-free, but the de Blasio administration resisted the report's release and does not appear to be interested in enacting its suggestions.
